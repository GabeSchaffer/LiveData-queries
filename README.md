Analysis of SQL queries used for Planner


1. Based on parameterized queries in `sql/`, use the parse_xml_query.py` script to get a list of tables.
2. Edit the `dot` defintions by hand. (Tried generating same, but skipped to writing by hand)

To generate the images, open a bash shell and execute `generate_image.sh` in the root folder.
